# Yours.co Interview Process

This repo lays out the interview process we use for engineers at Yours.co, as well as some code challenges for them.

### Why Document It?

So we don't wing it. We can change it all we want, but we should at least know what we are trying to accomplish in an interview.

## Here It Is (Share this with job seekers)

The purpose of an interview is to see what it is like for us to work together. To that end, our interview process looks a lot like working together: writing code, pair programming, code reviews, architecture discussions, and conversations about building a team.

Our work does not typically involve solving graph coloring problems on a whiteboard by hand in front of an audience of strangers. That means our interviews don’t ask you do that either.

We will explore the boundaries of your knowledge. Not knowing the answer to something is not a failure in an interview any more than it is a failure in work.

Here is what to expect:

0. We have a quick (20 minute) phone call to talk about your experience, answer your preliminary questions, and make sure we both want to proceed.
0. You send us some code in whatever language or tech stack you want. If you have code you can share (either open-source or closed-source) that would be great. Not everyone has code they can share. If you don’t, we have a small code challenge for you to take which you should spend no more than two hours on. The goal is to give us something to discuss in the next phase, not to see how far you get or how much time you can dedicate to this random project.
0. Once we have your code sample, we do an in-person interview. First we’ll talk about questions you have about the position, the company, and so on. Then we’ll spend about 30 minutes discussing the code you submitted. We are looking to understand the thought behind your code. Does it have tests? Why did you make a particular architectural choice? How would this code hold up under changing requirements? What would you change if you knew then what you know now?
0. Next we spend an hour or so pair-programming on the existing Yours.co codebase. Don’t worry if you don’t know our tech stack. We want to see how you think and how we work together, not to discover if you know the [insert JS framework of the day] API by heart.
0. Then you meet with the CEO and product owner. You’d be working closely with them, and we’d like you to get to know each other a bit.
0. At this point, we know and love each other, so all that is left to do is discuss an offer!

The whole thing should take five to seven hours. These steps can happen at whatever pace works for you. If you have questions or feedback, just email us. There is always a human ready to answer. Send your resumé or any questions to jobs@yours.co.


## Code Challenges

We want to see code you've written. Some people don't have open source or freely available code they can share, so we have some short code challenges they can do.

Use whatever language and tech stack you're most comfortable with.

Please try not to spend more than two hours coding. This is to protect you; we don't want you to spend hours coding only for either one of us to decide later we aren't a good fit for each other.

Just like in real life, you can use the internet to help you remember some syntax or figure out a library. Unlike real life, you *should not* use someone else's solution for the coding challenge. Use good judgement. Googling how to read in a file is fine. Googling "how does a spell-checker work" to get a basic idea of an algorithm is fine. Copying and pasting a spell-checker you've found online is not fine.

The goal isn't to finish the assignment (though we won't complain if you do!). The goal is to see how you approach a problem. Can you decide on and implement an algorithm? What data structures do you use? How do you organize your code? What parts of the problem seem most important to solve?

Please contact us if anything in the instructions is confusing. We've tried to leave space for creativity and problem-solving, but we also don't want you becoming frustrated or stuck.

## Instructions For Submission

Please email us a link to a GitHub repository. Include a `README.md` file with notes for us. If your code runs, please include instructions for running it.
