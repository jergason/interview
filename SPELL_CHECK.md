# Make a Spell Checker!

We want to see code you've written. Some people don't have open source or freely available code they can share, so we have some short code challenges they can do.

Use whatever language and tech stack you're most comfortable with.

Please try not to spend more than two hours coding. This is to protect you; we don't want you to spend hours coding only for either one of us to decide later we aren't a good fit for each other.

Just like in real life, you can use the internet to help you remember some syntax or figure out a library. Unlike real life, you *should not* use someone else's solution for the coding challenge. Use good judgement. Googling how to read in a file is fine. Googling "how does a spell-checker work" to get a basic idea of an algorithm is fine. Copying and pasting a spell-checker you've found online is not fine.

The goal isn't to finish the assignment (though we won't complain if you do!). The goal is to see how you approach a problem. Can you decide on and implement an algorithm? What data structures do you use? How do you organize your code? What parts of the problem seem most important to solve?

Please contact us if anything in the instructions is confusing. We've tried to leave space for creativity and problem-solving, but we also don't want you becoming frustrated or stuck.

## The Problem

Write a program that checks spelling. The input to the program is a dictionary file containing a list of valid English words and a file containing the text to be checked.

The program should run on the command line like so:

```bash
my-cool-spellchecker dictionary.txt file-to-check.txt
# output here
```

## The Features

Your program should support the following features (time permitting):

* The program outputs a list of incorrectly spelled words.
* For each misspelled word, the program outputs a list of suggested words.
* The program includes the line and column number of the misspelled word
* The program prints the misspelled word along with some surrounding context.
* The program handles proper nouns (person or place names, for example) correctly.

## Instructions For Submission

Please email us a link to a GitHub repository. Include a `README.md` file with notes for us. If your code runs, please include instructions for running it.
